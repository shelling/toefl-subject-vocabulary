## Prerequisite
This file is tested with XeTeX included in Texlive. Even though, you can use
other similar TeX system compatible with XeTeX in Texlive.

All recommended prerequisite are listed here:
    texlive package
    texlive-xetex package
    BiauKai truetype font
    Arial truetype font
    make command

## Compile
run 'make' directly. PDF file would be generated at project root directory.
